# POGN Games Sandbox
[POGN Games Sandbox Demo](https://pogngamesandbox-eac15b3c6192.herokuapp.com/)

Develop games for pogn straight out of the POGN Games Sandbox demo.

The idea here is causal coders and gamers could use a predefined prompt to create simple games.  Since the turn base play and general gameplay (ie rounds and roles) can be handled in base classes the "gameshell" provides a simple framework for a well prompted llm to create a simple game server/client pair for a custom game. Here the pogngamesandbox "wraps" the users input code with the necessary base classes to make such an arrangement work. 

Pognsandbox can evolve to be a general development tool for more complex games.
